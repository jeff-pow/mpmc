Input File Specifications
*************************

The bulk of MPMC runs require two plain text files, the input script and the PQR file. The input script contains all of the options defining the type of run to be performed as well as details about the potentials used and control of the output. The PQR file contains the atomic positions of the system being ran as well as force field parameters such as partial charges and van der Waals coefficients.
