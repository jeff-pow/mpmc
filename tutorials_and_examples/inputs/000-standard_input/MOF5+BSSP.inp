job_name                        MOF5+BSSP ! job name, which will determine output file names

ensemble                        uvt ! thermodynamic ensemble, e.g. Grand-Canonical here. NVT, NPT etc. are possible.

numsteps                        100 ! Total number of MC steps to run.
corrtime                        4 ! Correlation time; the number of steps between samples (numsteps/corrtime = total num. samples)

insert_probability              0.667 ! Probability at each step to add or remove a sorbate molecule.

! move_factor
!if 1, a molecule may move throughout the entire box randomly on a displace move (the only possible moves in uvt are insertion, deletion and displace, displace is a combined translation and rotation)
! if 0.5, a molecule may only move a max of half the box length randomly on a displace move
move_factor			0.01

! rot_factor
! if 0.5, a molecule may only rotate a max of 180 degress in a given direction randomly
rot_factor	                0.01

temperature                     50.0 ! T of system in K
pressure                        1.0 ! P of system in atm
h2_fugacity                     on ! Fugacity option for pressure correction (for H2 it is usually negligable)
feynman_hibbs			on ! A correction algorithm to improve energy with a bit of QM
feynman_hibbs_order		4 ! Related to form of F-H equation


!!free_volume			18280.82098 ! free volume (NOT total volume) of unit cell in A^3. This value is not correct for MOF-5 so it's commented out.
basis1                          25.669  0.0     0.0 ! Unit cell "box" parameters. Cubes, e.g., are a diagonal matrix with identical values.
basis2                          0.0     25.669  0.0
basis3                          0.0     0.0     25.669

polar_gamma             	1.03
polar_max_iter          	4		! the above are parameters for polarization algorithm.

wrapall                         on		! auto-wrap the simulation box with the given MOF (in case there is some deviation)
pqr_input                       input.pqr	! define the input PDB file to read!
pop_histogram           	on		! generate a histogram file for visualization later
pop_histogram_output    	histogram.dat   ! filename for the above
!parallel_restarts		on		! parallel restarts option (only available if included in compilation)
