This is K. Forrest's work
=========================

Mg rho-ZMOF files are attached. Please note that we do not match experiment
using these settings and parameters (in fact we over sorb massively). This is
attributed to the fact that the wet chemists use a structure which is not fully
activated (i.e. contains unaccounted for water molecules). The presence of this
water has been confirmed experimentally using tga.

If you want, you can try to reproduce these data for the Buch, BSS, and BSSP
models for simulations in Mg-rho-ZMOF at 77 K with the included *.png

The included model here is BSSP.
