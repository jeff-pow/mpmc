==============================

Included is a TGZ file containing the PDB files with the BSS model                                  
located at all four H2 sorption sites in MOF-5 (alpha. beta, gamma, and delta).                               
An input file to run the quantum rotation calculations is also included in the                                
TGZ file. Note that running quantum rotations calculations is predicated upon                                 
turning the quantum rotations part of the code on when compiling MPMC. By                                     
executing quantum rotation calculations on the four H2 sorption sites, you                                    
should obtain rotational levels that are very close to those shown in Table 1                                 
of Ivana's JCP 2012 paper (see included paper) for the respective sites.
