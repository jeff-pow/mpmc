======================================

These input files will run a multi-sorbate simulation in an rht-MOF (NOTT-112).
The two sorbates are H2 (BSSP) and CO2 (PHAST). I have done 3 sorbates in this
system with success (e.g. N2). Pretty sure code is generalized to any number of
sorbates.

Files:
1. insert.pqr:
	Only needed for multi-sorbate simulations (for gas sorption)
	Includes the sorbate models to be included
2. input.pqr:
	Includes the MOF coordinates and initial sorbate (only 1 is needed)
3. *.inp:
	The actual MPMC input file, which cites the above 2 sub-inputs.

This is one of the largest (in phase-space and atom count) systems we've ever
worked on, so it takes a while. Especially for large corrtime in *.inp.
